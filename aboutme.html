      <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Whoa, didn't see you there. My name is Jayson Pacio, youre probably wondering how i got here. I am a senior at Don Lugo High School and this is for my AP Computer Science Class. </p>
   
   <p>In my life, I love many different things, like my family (usually), friends, dogs, sleep, and sushi. I don't really have a favorite subject, because I hate them all equally. Well, math is cool though, I guess. I'm not really sure where I would go to college, but I am fine with most things as long as it's a good school.</p>
