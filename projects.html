      <p>My first completed project in AP Computer Science was my Scratch project. The project is loosely based off the anime My Hero Academia where you play as a student in a high school for superheroes. Throughout the game, you save the world by fighting various supervillains.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the game is to have users become immersed in a funny story through the impact of their actions. They will be prompted with multiple choices in how to deal with something or in deciding what their superpowers are.</p>
      <p>One of the first difficulties I faced while working on the project was deciding whether the separate dialogues of each scene should be separate sprites in Scratch, or each bit of dialogue is their own sprite. What I ended up doing was having each scene have their own dialogue sprite. That sprite would have multiple costumes for each piece of dialogue/action. This way, it would be more organized and avoid complicating the scripts for each scene. It was certainly more easy than our first version with each text box having its own sprite. Another difficulty later on was how to implement the effect of the quirk you chose during each scene. This was based on initial feedback where we were encouraged to make your superpower have an impact on the story. After some testing, we decided the best way to do this was have a nested if-else statement where a bit of dialogue pops up differing on what quirk you chose. So attacking an enemy would display an action saying you lit their head on fire or shot eye lasers at them based on your quirk, for example.</p>
      <p>During the project, I learned more and expanded my skills on things such as algorithms and variables. These are important skills in the class because they will show up later on especially when we are working on other games.</p>
