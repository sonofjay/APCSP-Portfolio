      <p>My first completed project in AP Computer Science was my Scratch project. The project is loosely based off the anime My Hero Academia where you play as a student in a high school for superheroes. Throughout the game, you save the world by fighting various supervillains.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the game is to have users become immersed in a funny story through the impact of their actions. They will be prompted with multiple choices in how to deal with something or in deciding what their superpowers are.</p>
      <p>One of the first difficulties I faced while working on the project was deciding whether the separate dialogues of each scene should be separate sprites in Scratch, or each bit of dialogue is their own sprite. What I ended up doing was having each scene have their own dialogue sprite. That sprite would have multiple costumes for each piece of dialogue/action. This way, it would be more organized and avoid complicating the scripts for each scene. It was certainly more easy than our first version with each text box having its own sprite. Another difficulty later on was how to implement the effect of the quirk you chose during each scene. This was based on initial feedback where we were encouraged to make your superpower have an impact on the story. After some testing, we decided the best way to do this was have a nested if-else statement where a bit of dialogue pops up differing on what quirk you chose. So attacking an enemy would display an action saying you lit their head on fire or shot eye lasers at them based on your quirk, for example.</p>
      <p>During the project, I learned more and expanded my skills on things such as algorithms and variables. These are important skills in the class because they will show up later on especially when we are working on other games.</p>

   <h2>App Design Challenge</h2>

   <p>In this project, we created an Android app using App Inventor provided by MIT. The app’s main purpose was to inform users on what tarter Pokémon is the best for their Pokémon game. Depending on the generation of starters, the user is given a set of information on that specific Pokémon. They are given basic info that describes what their specialties are and how difficult it would be to use them in the game. The video begins with the Start Screen with a simple background and button. The button leads you to the generation select screen, where you choose which generation the game you are playing is in. After that, you are lead to a screen where you are prompted to choose your starter. The color determines what type of starter it is. Once they are chosen, you are shown a picture of the starter and some useful information about them. This is the case for all generations of starter Pokémon from Generation 1 to Generation 7.</p>

   <h2>Interactive Fiction Project</h2>

   <p>For our first Python project, we made an interactive fiction story and it uses Python 2.7.10 as a programming language. The purpose of the program is to have a choose-your-own-adventure style of story able to played through the use of a Python computer program. The story is based on a true story, and it has players learn important life lessons. There are multiple endings, all of which give you an important lesson even if the ending was a bad one. The video depicts the true ending where you make all of the correct decisions. The video shows that you must type a certain input in the command line to make decisions. These are accomplished through the use of functions and nesting of functions within other functions, and are what allows you to make your own decisions.</p>
   <p>Our interactive fiction project uses modules in order to make the code easier to read and more organized. This organization allows us to see what sections are causing errors or what part of the story is creating the said error. When doing it in this way, we do not need to remove an entire chunk of code in order to fix it and creating more errors in the process. For example, the intro function is the very first function and within it, there is another function that is called. This process is repeated in modules to make things easier. The second example shows the bully function is used in two places, so this makes things much easier. If the function were not defined, then you would need to copy and paste that segment of code two times, making the code much lengthier than needed. Completing the code within one single strip of code and not in modules would make it unorganized, harder to read, and unprofessional.</p>

   <p>For this final Python proect, we used Python 2.7.10 as the programming language. The purpose of the program is to mainly showcase a translator that translates English into the fake language known as Pig Latin. There also a few silly smaller “languages” such as an “uwu” translator that changes l’s and r’s to w’s, and a b emoji translator that causes c’s and k’s to become b’s. The video begins with the main function, language_select(), which allows you to choose any of these 3 languages. Each of them are run with an example sentence. Each one has a prompt that asks you to input an English phrase or sentence, and once it is sent, the output is a translation of that input.</p>
